                <p>Thanks to our sales teams around the world, whenever consumers want a Red&nbsp;Bull, a can is close
                    at hand. Single cans and multi-packs are merchandised and sold in supermarkets, convenience stores,
                    gas stations, restaurants, bars, e-commerce sites, and at some unexpected locations too, including
                    hotels, festivals, and specialty retailers.

                    Red&nbsp;Bull sales teams are channel-oriented and organized into Off Premise (retailers, where the
                    product is consumed later) and On Premise (hospitality venues, where the can is opened and enjoyed
                    immediately). Fun fact: did you know that the first Red&nbsp;Bull sold was here in Salzburg in a
                    local On Premise account?

                    With experts in the areas of Key Accounts, Field Sales, Distribution, Category Management, Insights
                    and Trade Marketing, our sales teams work collaboratively across business channels to build customer
                    partnerships, secure availability and brand presence, and drive maximum consumer impact. Our sales
                    teams maximize the steady profits that keep the entire company strong and growing. </p><a

                    The process begins with the Product Innovation team, developing and introducing the products

                    based on business insights.

                    Strategic IT functions such as concepts, architecture, management and standards, are managed
                    internally whereas other IT functions (development, operations, support) are either outsourced or
                    automated.

                    Media Technology teams work across the entire digital media supply chain and technology stack to
                    facilitate the streaming and storage of content, the management of digital rights and its technical
                    infrastructure, to support the vision of bringing content to life.

                    A dynamic, digital environment allows us to achieve our goals while being challenged and enriched by
